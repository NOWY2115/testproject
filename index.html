			<article class="first">My name is Paul, but I work under the artist name 'NOWY'. I'm an 18-year-old guy from
				Poland. I took up a passion for music at the age of 14 and a hobby for coding a year later. Right now
				I'm putting out my tracks at <a class="link" href="https://push.fm/fl/nowy" target="_blank">these
					services</a> and I
				occasionally code. All public results can be seen <a class="link" href="https://github.com/NOWY2115"
					class="link" target="_blank">here</a>. What I also consider as worth adding is the fact that I own a
				C2 Cambridge English certificate, so if you need to translate anything from Polish to English or vice
				versa, just hit me up ^^.

				<h2>Staring from music...</h2>
				<p>At first I was really into rap music. Don't get me wrong, I'm still a fan of it, but lately I just like experimenting with different genres.</p>
				<p>Recently it's been hyperpop and digicore, which struck close to my heart. The synthy vibes, the possibilities for both depressive and positive melodies, the percussion, which is simply just beautiful - those things resonate with me very deeply.</p>
				<p>Maybe my music isn't very popular amongst the general audience (at least yet), but I really hope to make it change in the upcoming years ^^. If you want to support me, just try to spread the word of it. I appreciate any support :3</p>

				<h2>...Through coding...</h2>
				<p>In case the former thing doesn't work out, I try to make a plan for my future at the moment. I really enjoy coding. I have a more-or-so comprehensible understanding of web development, that means HTML, CSS, JS and a fair share of PHP and SQL. I'm also currently working on improving my knowledge of C#, C++ and Python. If you ever need help with anything simple, feel free to message my mail, I'll see if I can do something for you.</p>

			<article class="long-text">
				<h2>...to English?</h2>
				<p>I think it's fair to say, that English is a language very close to me. I've been learning it for over a decade now and in 2024 I achieved a C2 Cambrdige certificate. Same as before, if you have any problem translating documents (Polish - English; English-Polish; that's worth noting), also mail me and I'll see what I can do for you.</p>
